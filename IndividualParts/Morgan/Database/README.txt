To get this to work properly, I think we will have to host it somewhere, otherwise, we can just use localhost, but anything 
that is changed will need to be sent again and reinput, if we can host it somewhere, we can get around this. For the 
time-being use this with localhost, hopefully we don't need to change anything. When we get back after Christmas we'll put
it onto one of our cems pages and we'll be able to access it on uni wifi. Couple of notes, the format of the opening and 
closing times will probably need to be changed, the area is in km^2, timezone is gmt+timezone(hours), any launch date 
that is 1st Jan is because there was no specific date, just a year, this might be able to be found if we look hard enough, 
but was taking too long.
