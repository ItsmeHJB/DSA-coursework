            <description> Starting with a simple design on MySQLWorkbench, we tried to keep the design 
                as simple as possible in order to reduce the stress on any php or javascript we used. In
                order to decide what we needed to implement and store, we looked at the specification 
                provided to us and broke it down into keys parts. </description>
            <problems> Some of the initial issues we faced included trying to decide what exactly we needed
                to include on our page to reach the functionality required, without making the database 
                overly large or complex and hard to manage. Another issue we had was that we needed a primary
                key for each of the cities and their places of interest. </problems>
            <solutions> By the end of our design process, we had devided that quite simple having 3 tables was
                our solution to the issues. One dedicated to the city information, another to the places of 
                interest (POI) and another to the photos associated with each POI. In order to solve the primary
                key issue, we simply used the 'Wear On Earth ID' (WOEID) number to identify places as this was
                a natural solution to our issue. </solutions>

            <description> When we came round to implemnting our database, we used phpmyadmin and a privately
                owned server to host the database on. We created our 3 seperate tables as manetioned in the 
                implementation area above. As we populated the database, we researched both Hull and Rotterdam 
                and what is available to do in each of these locations. </description>
            <problems> One of the issues we faced was that a lot of the POI's didn't have a lot of in common
                features like a capacity or entry fee like we originally proposed. Furthermore, we found that
                the images couldn't actually be stored directly on the database. </problems>
            <solutions> In order to overcome the first issue, we had to simply display null for a few values 
                in the table such as the capacity of Hull City Centre. As for the second issue, we decided 
                to store the images locally and assign each photo an ID to be pulled instead. </solutions>

            <description> First off, we identified that we were going to have 3 pages. The main page which 
                displayed the weather and location of each city with the weather at the top and the map at 
                the bottom. Then for each of the subpages decicated to each city, we were going to use 
                the same format of having the map on the left with all of the POI's displayed on it
                followed by the weather on the left. </description>
